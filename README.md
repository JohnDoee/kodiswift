A micro framework to enable rapid development of Kodi plugins.


## Features
* Run the addon from the command line *or* within Kodi without changing any
  code.
* Helper libraries to make common Kodi API operations easy, like adding items,
  getting settings, creating temporary files, etc.
* Handles all the url parsing involved in plugin routing. No need to deal with
  complicated URLs and query strings.

## Documentation

TODO: Clean up documentation.

## Upgrading from xbmcswift2

This project is a fork of xbmcswift2. The APIs in the current release 
are the same as xbmcswift2 but with added listitem properties and 
other enhancements.

## Contributing

Bugs, patches and suggestions are all welcome. I'm working on adding tests and
getting better coverage. Please ensure that your patches include tests as well
as updates to the documentation. Thanks!
